## üìñ Lessons Learned

### Separation of Concerns with MVC
- **Model** ‚Äì defines calculator data (operands, selected operation, result)
- **Controller** ‚Äì handles logic and calculations
- **View** ‚Äì manages the user interface

### Cross-Platform Development
- Code reuse between web and desktop platforms
- Understanding differences between browser and Electron environments
- Working with Electron's main and renderer processes

### User Interface & Interaction
- Implementing keyboard event listeners (keydown/keyup)
- CSS pseudo-classes vs JavaScript class manipulation
- Creating visual feedback for user actions
- DOM manipulation with getElementById and classList

### Version Control
- Feature branch workflow
- Managing Git repositories with proper commit messages
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Understanding Git directory structure

## üîÆ Planned Features (Roadmap)

### Web
- Display calculation history
- Store history in a database (full-stack demo)
- Responsive design and improved styling
- Unit tests for calculator logic

### Desktop
- Packaged installer for Windows/Mac/Linux
- Custom app icon
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts
- Theme customization options
- Settings persistence
