- **Controller** â€“ handles logic and calculations.  
- **View** â€“ manages the user interface.
- ### Cross-platform Development
- Code reuse between web and desktop platforms
- Understanding the differences between browser and Electron environments

### Electron  
- How to bundle existing JS/HTML logic into a cross-platform desktop app.  
- Working with npm, Electron main/renderer process.  
- Branching workflow in GitHub (feature branches, pull requests, merging).

## ðŸ”® Planned Features (Roadmap)  

### Web  
- Display calculation history.  
- Store history in a database (full-stack demo).  
- Responsive design and improved styling.  
- Unit tests for calculator logic.  

### Desktop  
- Packaged installer for Windows/Mac/Linux.
